---------------
Create a Java program that defines a method modifyValue to perform modifications on an integer value using a provided consumer. The program should include three consumers: doubleValue, incrementBy, and squareValue, each with different modification operations. Your task is to implement the modifyValue method such that it accepts an integer value and a consumer as parameters, and applies the modification specified by the consumer to the value.

class name  ValueModifier(ELC): 

Define a method modifyValue in the ValueModifier class :
Method name : modifyValue
Access Modifier : public
Non-Access Modifier : static
return type : void
parameters : int value, Consumer<Integer>
This method should apply the operation specified by the consumer to the value.
Implement the modifyValue method such that it applies the operation specified by the consumer to the value.

In the main method:
Define three consumers:
doubleValue: Doubles the value.
incrementBy: Increments the value by a given value increment.
squareValue: Squares the value.

Define a sample integer value (e.g., 5).
Test each consumer using the modifyValue method and print the modified value after each operation.

Example Output:
Original value: 5
After doubling the value: 10
After incrementing the value by 3: 8
After squaring the value: 25

Test Case 1:
For sampleValue = 5:

Expected Output :
Original value: 5
After doubling the value: 10
After incrementing the value by 3: 8
After squaring the value: 25

Test Case 2: 
Negative Value = -8

Expected Output :
Original value: -8
After doubling the value: -16
After incrementing the value by 3: -5

Test Case 3: Zero Value = 0
Expected Output :
Original value: 0
After doubling the value: 0
After incrementing the value by 3: 3

Assignment 02 :
----------------
Question:

Create a Java program that defines a method applyFunction to apply a function to a given integer value. The program should include three functions: add, multiply, and subtract, each with different operations. Your task is to implement the applyFunction method such that it accepts an integer value and a function as parameters, and applies the operation specified by the function to the value.

FunctionApplier class(ELC) :

Method name : applyFunction
Access Modifier : public
Non-Access Modifier : static
return type : int
parameters : int value,  Function<Integer, Integer>
This method should apply the operation specified by the function to the value and return the result.

In the main method:
Define three functions:
add: Adds a given value increment to the input value.
multiply: Multiplies the input value by a given value factor.
subtract: Subtracts a given value decrement from the input value.

Define a sample integer value (e.g., 10).
Test each function using the applyFunction method and print the result after each operation.

Test Case 1:
For sampleValue = 10:

Expected Output :
Original value: 10
After adding 5: 15
After multiplying by 2: 20
After subtracting 3: 7

Test Case 2: 
Negative Value = -15

Expected Output :
Original value: -15
After adding 5: -10
After multiplying by 2: -30
After subtracting 3: -18

Test Case 3: 
Large Value = 100

Expected Output :
Original value: 100
After adding 5: 105
After multiplying by 2: 200
After subtracting 3: 97


Assignment - 3
--------------
Create a Java program using the Supplier interface to generate random passwords. The password should be 8 characters long.

Contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters (e.g., @, #, $, !).

Coding  Requirements:
Create a PasswordGenerator class.

Inside the main method :

Define character sets [For password generation as shown below]

 String upper = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
 String lower = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
 String digits = "0123456789";
 String special = "@#$%!&*";

Combine all the character set into a single String

Define a Supplier<String> named passwordSupplier which will generate and return a Random Password (Using all character set) by using java.util.Random class.

Use this supplier to generate and print a random secure password.

Output :

Generated Password: Ab3#eT9!
