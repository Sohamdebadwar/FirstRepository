Interface Scenario ====>>>

Develop a scenario based program by using interface for processing the payment 
using different available options like Credit Card and Debit Card and UPI Payment. Provide loose coupling through interface.
 
Create a sealed interface called Payment.
An end user can make a payment through CreditCard OR DebitCard OR UPI. No other payment mode is allowed.

Methods of Payment interface :
------------------------------
 void makePayment(double amount);
 void makeRefund(double amount);
 
Create a BLC class called CreditCardPayment which implements from Payment interface.

Fields :
cardHolderName : String private

Use a parameterized constructor to initialize the field.

Override all the abstract methods from Payment interface to write the business logic.



Create another BLC class called DebitCardPayment which implements from Payment interface.

Fields :
bankName : String private

Use a parameterized constructor to initialize the field.

Override all the abstract methods from Payment interface to write the business logic.



Create another BLC class called UPIPayment which implements from Payment interface.

Fields :
upiId : String private

Use a parameterized constructor to initialize the field.

Override all the abstract methods from Payment interface to write the business logic.



Create another BLC class ShoppingCart which provides loose coupling.

Fields :
totalAmount : double private [The total bill amount we need to pay]

Use parameterized constructor to initialize the field.

Methods :
---------    
    1) Method Name 		: checkout()
       Argument   		: One argument of type Payment
       Return Type 		: void
       Access modifier		: public
       In this method write a logic to make payment using dynamic polymorphism

   2) Method Name 		: cancelOrder()
       Argument   		: One argument of type Payment
       Return Type 		: void
       Access modifier		: public
       In this method write a logic to initiate the refund process using dynamic polymorphism



Create an ELC class Customer with main method to test this application. Write 
Switch case with Scanner class to test the working of this application as shown in the below Test Cases.
       
    Test Cases for Output :
    ------------------------

1. Credit Card
2. Debit Card

Enter your total bill Amount :
9000
Choose Payment Method:
1. Credit Card
2. Debit Card

Order Canceled. Initiating Refund...
Cancelling order for amount RS :9000.0
Refunded RS :9000.0 to Debit Card Bank: State Bank of India


Test Case 3 :
-------------
Enter your total bill Amount :
12000
Choose Payment Method:
1. Credit Card
2. Debit Card
3. UPI
3

Paid RS 12000.0 using UPI ID : reach_scott@upi

Order Canceled. Initiating Refund...
Cancelling order for amount RS :12000.0
Refunded RS 12000.0 to UPI ID : reach_scott@upi

Customer
You are required to build a payment processing system that allows customers to make payments for their shopping cart using different payment methods.

The system must use interfaces with loose coupling so that new payment methods can be easily added in the future.

Requirements:

Create a sealed interface Payment that has the following methods:

void makePayment(double amount)

void makeRefund(double amount)

Implement three classes that provide payment options:

CreditCardPayment

Field: private String cardHolderName

Parameterized constructor

Implement business logic for payment & refund

DebitCardPayment

Field: private String bankName

Parameterized constructor

Implement business logic for payment & refund

UPIPayment

Field: private String upiId

Parameterized constructor

Implement business logic for payment & refund

Create a ShoppingCart class that contains:

Field: private double totalAmount

Constructor to initialize total amount

checkout(Payment payment) → makes the payment dynamically using polymorphism

cancelOrder(Payment payment) → initiates refund dynamically using polymorphism

Create a Customer class with main() that:

Takes user input for total amount

Takes input for payment method (1 = Credit Card, 2 = Debit Card, 3 = UPI)

Uses switch-case to dynamically choose the payment method

Calls checkout() and cancelOrder() accordinglyYou are required to build a payment processing system that allows customers to make payments for their shopping cart using different payment methods.

Create a Customer class with main() that:

Takes user input for total amount

Takes input for payment method (1 = Credit Card, 2 = Debit Card, 3 = UPI)

Uses switch-case to dynamically choose the payment method

Calls checkout() and cancelOrder() accordingly


Input Format


First line: A double representing the total bill amount.

Second line: An integer representing the payment method option.

1 → Credit Card

2 → Debit Card

3 → UPI

amount > 0

Valid choices for payment method: 1, 2, or 3.

If amount is invalid (<= 0) or choice is invalid, display appropriate error message.

Starting checkout for amount RS :<amount>
Paid RS :<amount> using <PaymentMode>

Order Canceled. Initiating Refund...
Cancelling order for amount RS :<amount>
Refunded RS :<amount> to <PaymentMode>
Sample Input
7000
1
MR.Ravi
Sample Output
Starting checkout for amount RS :7000.0
Paid RS :7000.0 using Credit Card Holder : MR.Ravi

Order Canceled. Initiating Refund...
Cancelling order for amount RS :7000.0
Refunded RS :7000.0 to Credit Card Holder : MR.Ravi
Constraints:
amount > 0

Valid choices for payment method: 1, 2, or 3.
